## Purpose and target audience
In today’s society, mental health issues have spread rapidly. The need for various forms of support is great. You hear more about mental health in the media, and it seems like people are seeing psychologists more frequently. Healing is becoming increasingly popular in Sweden, with Reiki being one of the treatment methods. That’s why I felt inspired to create a website for someone who is trained in this field. The idea is for the website to be developed further and include more information and features. The site is aimed at adults aged 20 and older, and is intended for both men and women.
